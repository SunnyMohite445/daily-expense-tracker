# Daily Expense Tracker – Python Data Analytics Project

## 📌 Project Overview
The **Daily Expense Tracker** is a console-based Python application designed from a **Data Analyst’s perspective** to help users monitor daily spending, analyze expense patterns, and make informed budgeting decisions.

The system captures raw expense data and converts it into meaningful financial insights such as total spend, category-wise distribution, waste percentage, and remaining budget — similar to how analysts design early-stage financial analysis tools before dashboards.
